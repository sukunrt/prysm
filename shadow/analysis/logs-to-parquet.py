r"""Turn a Shadow run's beacon-chain logs into queryable parquet tables, with duckdb.

    ./logs-to-parquet.py data23 parquet/run23
    ./logs-to-parquet.py data23 parquet/run23 --validate
    ./logs-to-parquet.py data23 parquet/run23 --validate-only
    ./logs-to-parquet.py data23 parquet/run23 --print-sql > run23.sql

DuckDB is the engine.  It globs ``<run>/**/prysm/logs/beacon-chain.log``, reads
every log as one row per line, pulls the logfmt fields out with
``regexp_extract`` in SQL, and ``COPY (...) TO '<table>.parquet' (FORMAT
PARQUET)``.  This script only builds that SQL and hands it to the ``duckdb``
CLI; it never touches a log line.  ``--print-sql`` gives you the same script to
run by hand: ``./logs-to-parquet.py data23 out --print-sql | duckdb``.

Parsing accounting is strict and lands in parquet, not in a log message:

    lines = matched_any + unmatched              (file_summary.parquet)
    matched = parsed + failed, per file, per table   (parse_stats.parquet)

A line "matches" a table when it carries that table's ``msg=`` marker.  It is
then either parsed into a row or counted as a failure -- never dropped quietly.
A row counts as parsed when every ``required`` field came back non-null
(``try_cast`` / ``try_strptime`` turn a malformed field into a null, not an
error), so ``matched = parsed + failed`` holds by construction.  The driver
prints both identities and exits non-zero if either fails to balance.


Tables
======

Every table carries ``node`` ("node7"), ``node_index`` (7, for sorting) and
``ts`` (the sim clock).  Join keys are (node, slot) and, where a validator is
involved, (node, slot, validator).

Adding a table is one entry in TABLES below: a ``msg=`` marker, the log fields
you want, and which of them must be present for the row to count as parsed.
The ffg_votes / ffg_inclusions entries are exactly that -- they are empty on
runs built before prysm 3cb8aa37 and fill in by themselves from run 25 on.

goldfish_votes -- msg="Goldfish vote", one row per availability (head) vote
    vote_slot, validator, seats, outcome, reason, class, arrived_ms,
    decided_ms, block_root, source
    outcome is accepted | local | queued | replayed | dropped; ``class`` is
    outcome with the drop reason appended ("dropped:slot_zero").
    The terminal outcomes are accepted, local, replayed and dropped.  "queued"
    and "replayed" are the same vote seen twice -- parked, then landed -- so
    counting queued as well double-counts.

finality_progression -- msg="Synced new block", the per-slot chain view
    slot, epoch, slot_in_epoch, block_root, block_hash, parent_root,
    parent_hash, justified_round, justified_root, finalized_round,
    finalized_root, finalized_slot, since_slot_start_ms,
    chain_service_processed_ms, builder_index, version

received_blocks -- msg="Received block", gossip arrival of each block
    slot, proposer_index, since_slot_start_ms, validation_time_ms, graffiti

payload_envelopes -- msg="Synced execution payload envelope"
    slot, block_root, block_hash, parent_hash

state_transitions -- msg="Finished applying state transition"
    slot, attestations, sync_bits_count, blob_kzg_commitment_count,
    builder_index, payload_hash, parent_hash

payload_attestations -- msg="Submitted payload attestation message"
    slot, validator_index, block_root

ffg_votes -- msg="FFG vote", one row per FFG attestation (prysm >= 3cb8aa37)
    att_slot, target_round, committee_index, validator, seats, outcome,
    arrived_ms, data_root, block_root.  outcome is gossip | local.
    data_root is the pool's grouping key -- two votes aggregate together
    exactly when it matches -- and block_root is the head the vote named.
    Both are empty on runs built before prysm f8ccc75f.

payload_ledger -- msg="Payload envelope", one row per envelope a node imported
    slot, block_root, builder_index, arrived_ms, tx_count, payload_bytes,
    gas_used, blob_count.  Every delivery route lands here -- gossip, the
    pending queue, a by-root fetch, initial sync, and the proposer's own
    publish -- so it is one row per envelope per node, not one per route.
    arrived_ms shares the vote ledger's clock basis (ms into the envelope's own
    slot), so payload arrival and vote arrival are directly comparable.
    blob_count is absent when the state carried no bid, so it can be null.

data_columns -- msg="Data column", one row per data column sidecar
    slot, block_root, column_index (0-127), kzg_commitment_count, arrived_ms,
    outcome.  outcome is gossip | local: gossip fires on live gossip and on the
    Gloas pending-queue drain (carrying the true arrival time), local is a
    column the node built or reconstructed itself.  A proposer self-publishes
    its own 128 columns and logs none of them, so per-node counts are lower on
    the proposing node for its own slot.

ffg_aggregates -- msg="FFG aggregate", one row per aggregate seen or produced
    att_slot, target_round, committee_index, aggregator_index, seats,
    outcome, arrived_ms, validators.  outcome is gossip | local; validators is
    the comma-separated validator indices the aggregation bits name, so the
    seats of an aggregate can be joined back to the votes that filled them.

ffg_inclusions -- msg="FFG vote included", one row per attestation in a block
    att_slot, block_slot, inclusion_slots, committee_index, seats, validators,
    data_root, block_root.  validators is the same comma-separated naming of
    the included seats.

ffg_aggregate_groups -- msg="FFG aggregate groups", one row per aggregation duty
    att_slot, committee_index, aggregator_index, groups, chosen_data,
    chosen_seats, group_seats.  group_seats is the raw rendering
    "dataRoot8:blockRoot8:seats,..." sorted by seats descending; each group's
    seats is a bit UNION over that group's candidates, while chosen_seats is
    the single published attestation's own bit count.  Explode it with
    string_split / unnest when you need per-group rows.

parse_stats -- one row per (log file, table): matched, parsed, failed
file_summary -- one row per log file: lines, matched_any, unmatched


Validation
==========

``--validate`` runs exactly these queries against the written parquet and
prints their rows.  Nothing is interpreted: a check either returns zero rows
(exact) or returns the offending rows with their delta.  Run them by hand with
``duckdb -c "<query>"`` from this directory.

1. Seat conservation.  Every slot >= 1 must carry seats_per_slot * nodes
   terminal seats (512 * 128 = 65536 in run 23).  Zero rows = exact.

    SELECT vote_slot, sum(seats) AS seats, sum(seats) - 65536 AS delta
    FROM 'parquet/run23/goldfish_votes.parquet'
    WHERE vote_slot >= 1 AND outcome IN ('accepted', 'local', 'replayed')
    GROUP BY vote_slot HAVING sum(seats) <> 65536
    ORDER BY vote_slot;

2. Slot 0 is its own shape -- the votes that arrive before the chain exists:

    SELECT class, count(*) AS rows, sum(seats) AS seats
    FROM 'parquet/run23/goldfish_votes.parquet'
    WHERE vote_slot = 0 GROUP BY 1 ORDER BY 1;

3. First justification and first finalization, and whether every node agrees
   on the slot at which it happened (nodes = 128, min_slot = max_slot):

    SELECT 'justified' AS what, min(justified_round) AS round FROM ...
    -- see FIRST_ROUND_SQL below; it reports round, min/max slot, node count.

4. Nothing was dropped on the floor during conversion:

    SELECT "table", sum(matched) AS matched, sum(parsed) AS parsed,
           sum(failed) AS failed
    FROM 'parquet/run23/parse_stats.parquet' GROUP BY 1 ORDER BY 1;

    SELECT sum(lines) AS lines, sum(matched_any) AS matched,
           sum(unmatched) AS unmatched
    FROM 'parquet/run23/file_summary.parquet';

Everyday question -- vote arrival distribution per slot:

    SELECT vote_slot, count(*) AS votes,
           quantile_cont(arrived_ms, 0.5) AS p50_ms,
           quantile_cont(arrived_ms, 0.95) AS p95_ms, max(arrived_ms) AS max_ms
    FROM 'parquet/run23/goldfish_votes.parquet'
    WHERE outcome = 'accepted' GROUP BY vote_slot ORDER BY vote_slot;
